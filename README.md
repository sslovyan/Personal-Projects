## Table of Contents

This repository holds all of my personal projects.  They fit into three different categories.

2. [Lean Six Sigma](https://github.com/sslovyan/Personal-Projects/tree/main/Lean%20Six%20Sigma)
3. [Tableau Public](https://github.com/sslovyan/Personal-Projects/tree/main/Tableau%20Public)

## Background

I'm an ex-[Navy nuke](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/navy-enlisted-rating-descriptions-nuclear-field-3345847) that discovered data science and engineering while earning my MBA.  As someone who enjoys math and science, I was instantly hooked.  I immediately pivoted my career into the data analytics field, finished my MBA with a concentration in Business Analytics, and followed up my MBA with a MS in Data Science and Engineering.  I'm always looking for ways to stretch my brain and learn something new.
