## Table of Contents

This repository holds all of my personal projects.  They fit into three different categories.

## Background

Here's a little about me.  I'm an ex-[Navy nuke](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/navy-enlisted-rating-descriptions-nuclear-field-3345847) that discovered data science and engineering while earning my MBA.  As someone who enjoys math and science, I was instantly hooked.  I immediately pivoted my career into the data analytics field, finished my MBA with a concentration in Business Analytics, and followed up my MBA with a MS in Data Science and Engineering.

## Future Content

I plan on adding the following sections in the near future:

4. Data Engineering
5. D3
6. Games
