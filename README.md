## Table of Contents

This repository holds all of my personal projects.  They fit into three different categories.

1. [Data Science](https://github.com/sslovyan/Personal-Projects/tree/main/Data%20Science)
2. [Lean Six Sigma](https://github.com/sslovyan/Personal-Projects/tree/main/Lean%20Six%20Sigma)
3. [Tableau Public](https://github.com/sslovyan/Personal-Projects/tree/main/Tableau%20Public)

## Background

Here's a little about me.  I'm an ex-Navy nuke that discovered data science and engineering while earning my MBA.  I learned a lot, but I wanted to learn more so I enrolled in a Data Science and Engineering graduate program.

## Future Content

I plan on adding the following sections in the near future:

4. Data Engineering
5. D3
6. Games
