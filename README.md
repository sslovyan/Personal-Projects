# Steven Slovyan - Projects Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my Project Portfolio!

## Index

This repository holds all of my personal projects.  They fit into three different categories.

1. Data Science
2. Lean Six Sigma
3. Tableau Public

## Background

Here's a little about me.  I'm an ex-Navy nuke that discovered data science and engineering while earning my MBA.  I learned a lot, but I wanted to learn more so I enrolled in a Data Science and Engineering graduate program.

## Future Content

I plan on adding the following sections in the near future:

4. Data Engineering
5. Web Development
